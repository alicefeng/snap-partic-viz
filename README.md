===============

This has Python scripts and R codes to create visualizations about the food stamps program (SNAP) in the US.  This was part of my final project for my data visualization and graphics class.  These visualizations were presented at the inauguration festivities for CMU's current president last November 2013.

The Python scripts generate svg files of maps by US congressional districts which depict the proportion of residents in each district receiving food stamps.  The maps also breakdown SNAP participation by race and age.

The R script creates time series plots using the Morris javascript library about historical SNAP participation rates as well as level of benefits distributed and total costs of the program.
